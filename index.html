                <div class="project-description">
                    <p class="project-subtitle">Could insurance move from pure transactional to digital safety partner?</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Client:</strong> Financial Services Swiss Insurance</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> client asked our support to validate the desirability of a new cyber security service. They had a clear business point of view (led by quantitative data), however they needed help to understand the multi-faceted nature of their customers and their needs and therefore to design a proper human centred service (helping also the insurance business to move from pure transactional to more life partner).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> first objective was to identify the different mindsets (behaviours, needs, aspirations of the customers) towards the topic of their life in digital and then cyber attacks and security. In the next phase I led the team to define in collaboration with the client team: the service vision, 24 new service concepts and the experience of the customer (customer journey) as well as the service blueprint enabling the experience.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> The MVP was launched in the Swiss market in February 2024. The service is now being subscribed (data under NDA).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong> I shaped the project with the client, defining scope, objectives and outcomes. I was responsible of the definition of the approach and the execution of: qualitative research (as complement to the existing quantitative), concept(s) definition, recommendations for the new services' operations.</p>

                <h2 class="project-title">02/ Digital Money Made Simple</h2>
                <div class="project-description">
                    <p class="project-subtitle">Could a traditional physical Financial Services company help its customers (mostly migrants) become more digital and financially savvy? Furthermore, are there new revenue opportunities?</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Client:</strong> International Financial Services</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> in the early 202, COVID closures removed the client's primary physical channels overnight, threatening core revenue. Most customers were non‑digital and financially inexperienced, so the organisation needed to digitise urgently while exploring long‑term growth beyond branch banking.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> we rapidly designed an accessible mobile banking app focused on "digital money" adoption for non‑digital, non‑financially savvy customers: simplified flows, assisted onboarding and contextual help. We integrated the app into a cross‑channel journey (call centres, SMS, physical touch points) to preserve trust and continuity for existing customers. We led a strategic Vision & Mission 2030 process: opportunity mapping, priority canvas, and a staged roadmap (MVPs → pilots → scale) aligned to brand strengths and 100M global customer reach.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> the new digital service launched in 2 European countries by 2022.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong> I shaped the project with the client, defining scope, objectives and outcomes. I was responsible of the definition of the approach and the execution of: qualitative research, concept(s) definition and service blueprint for the digital banking service. I was lead of the design for the concept of the digital bank app. I was responsible and part of the research part for the future-casting exercise. Overall I was responsible of the streams project overview ensuring quality and consistency of our deliverables across the streams.</p>

                    <p class="project-subtitle">Could a traditional physical Financial Services company help its customers (mostly migrants) become more digital and financially savvy? Furthermore, are there new revenue opportunities?</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Client:</strong> Etisalat UAE</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Etisalat needed to shift from a traditional telco to a human‑centric, digitally native brand across digital and physical touchpoints to increase brand relevance, customer experience and commercial performance in a competitive regional market.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> we delivered an embedded the design capability that translated Etisalat's brand into a cohesive digital and physical experience, enabling faster product launches and commercial expansion from Consumer to B2B. We set up an internal design studio (roughly 16 people) in 4 months and in parallel we launched new digital first services for the Consumer Customer Base. After 18 months the scope expanded to the Business Customer Base.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> we launched in the first 18 months a fully revamped app and web e-commerce and self care platform, a new youth focused TelCo service, Loyalty. Etisalat became in 2017 the most recognisable brand in Middle East.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong> I shaped the project with the client, defining the scope. Subsequently I was the studio co-lead (in partnership with a client employee). I recruited and onboarded the 16 Fjord designers embedded into Etisalat. I coordinated and executed the delivery of most of the single projects (digital app revamp, new e-commerce and self case platform) including the translation of the brand into digital.</p>
