                <h3>Review of the brief and approach agreement</h3>
                <p>Data and statistics made client pretty confident that their customers knowingly needed a cyber security service. However day to day experience (data on actual exposure of consumers to cyber attacks) was showing a low awareness of the digital risks.</p>
                
                <p>Client, moreover had already an idea of service based simply on a web portal with some information non tailored.</p>
                
                <p>We proposed a quick qualitative research (complementary to the available statistics) to help us understand the different mindsets of people towards the digital and its potential risks. Through mindsets we intended to also better define tailored services or part of services.</p>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Research Prompts Visualization</div>
                
                <h3>Exploration and validation</h3>
                <p>We carried on 12 interviews with prompts aiming to understand the attitude of people towards their digital life: where, when and how they use digital tools and platforms? How much are they autonomous or relying on more savvy people for use and safety?</p>
                
                <p><strong>What I did here:</strong> I led the interview approach preparation and the synthesis of the information.</p>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Mindset Paper Visualization</div>
                
                <h3>Mindsets</h3>
                <p>We derived archetype mindsets to guide us in the identification of business priority (target mindset to tackle) and more tailored service definition.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What I did here:</strong> I contributed to the synthesis, identification of the forces leading to mindsets and overall structure.</p>

                <h3>Guidelines And Solutions</h3>
                <p>Mixing qualitative research, quantitative, desk research and the expertise of the client team we have been able to derive:</p>
                
                <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <li>Guiding principles, to help us in the definition of the service concepts but also in the future for the management of the service after lunch</li>
                    <li>25 service concepts (from support during digital life, communication, education to insurance)</li>
                    <li>The customer journey explaining the experience of the customers in each channel and each moment of their life</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Service Guidelines Visualization</div>
                
                <h3>Guiding principles</h3>
                <p>I have been the promoter of the realisation of the guiding principles and operatively creating them. Each version was though peer reviewed by the rest of the team.</p>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Guiding Principles Framework</div>
                
                <h3>Service Concepts and Customer Journey</h3>
                <p>I co-led the planning and preparation of the series of workshops that lead to the realisation of the concepts and customer journeys.</p>
                
                <p>I have also been part of the hands on preparation of the content for both.</p>

                <h3>Validating the proposed solutions</h3>
                <p>We did two runs of tests for the services we conceived:</p>
                
                <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <li>first one just testing the scenarios on line with the support of sketched storyboards</li>
                    <li>once we had a clearer idea of potential situations, experience and revised services we proposed an in presence test with a simulation of potential uses of digital services, risks and attacks and evaluated the response of interviewees.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Testing Setup Visualization</div>
                
                <h3>What I did here:</h3>
                <p>I co-led with a colleague the planning and preparation of the tests and I was observer and note taker during the execution. Afterwards I worked with the team for the definition of the recommendations.</p>
