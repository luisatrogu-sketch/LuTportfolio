- If it says "None", click the dropdown and select **"Deploy from a branch"**

**Branch:**
- First dropdown: Select **"main"**
- Second dropdown: Select **"/ (root)"**
- Click **"Save"** button

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Settings tab"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged into GitHub as `luisatrogu-sketch`

### "I see Settings but no Pages option"
**Solution:** 
- The repository must be Public (not Private)
- Go to Settings → scroll to bottom → Check "Danger Zone"
- Make sure visibility is "Public"

### "Pages shows 'Upgrade to enable GitHub Pages'"
**Solution:** This happens with private repos on free accounts
- Go to Settings → scroll to bottom
- Under "Danger Zone" click "Change visibility"
- Select "Make public"

## ✅ Once Enabled

It takes 1-2 minutes to deploy the first time.
