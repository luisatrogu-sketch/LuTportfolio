                <h2 class="section-title">Understanding The Problem</h2>
                
                <h3>Understanding of the context and what was already been done</h3>
                <p>During our initial conversations, we understood that a lot of data was already available. This proved both the need to improve the digital money transfer service and the strong interest of their customer base in becoming banked by our client. The data was clear. Less evident were the motivations driving customers to stay with our client for banking services - especially for pure digital banking. Many of their customers were unbanked, not digitally savvy, and far from financially savvy. Being migrants, they were deeply rooted in their home countries while also trying to establish themselves in the new destination country.</p>
                
                <p>We therefore proposed to carry on a series of interviews, in which we would validate the data already available and understand the above mentioned motivations that would have helped us to move core customers gradually away from cash, educating them to digital money.</p>
                
                <h3>Exploration and validation</h3>
                <p>We conducted several interviews across three destination countries (and few guerrilla shadowing sessions when lock down rules in Italy relaxed slightly). We collected insights on habits and common struggles with money management, use of digital channels, and relationships with financial institutions. We also looked at customers' feelings and ambitions regarding their sense of belonging to two different countries and cultures.</p>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Customer Interview Insights</div>
                
                <h3>Highlights</h3>
                <p>As a result, customers confirmed their trust in our client as a potential financial institution to serve them as a bank. However, they also showed a strong need for more than just digital interaction; they wanted guidance, human support, and a personal connection.</p>

                <h3>Not Only Digital</h3>
                <p>In this phase of the project, we focused on creating a solution that was both business-viable and aligned with customers' needs and expectations. Although the client had heard the demand for more than just digital interaction and a stronger personal connection with the brand, we still needed to further convince them to go beyond being only a digital bank. We allied with the part of client team more sensitive to the topic, more linked to the field and into more external cases to use as example and inspiration. We managed to at least prepare a plan for a whole experience in which the brand would provide also physical moments of contact to its customers and state this plan in a customer journey.</p>
                
                <div class="placeholder-image">Multi-Channel Experience Journey</div>
                
                <h3>Service Concepts and Customer Journey Creation</h3>
                <p>We identified 6 areas of opportunities responding to the key customers' needs and for each one of them defined services that across channels would define the experience.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What I did here:</strong> Together with a colleague, I was vocal in pushing for a comprehensive solution—one that considered the need for more personal and human interaction, while also guiding less digitally savvy customers in using digital money and becoming more financially confident. We did this by holding dedicated meetings to show the value of such a solution in light of the interview results, while also reinforcing how the client's heritage could support it and differentiate them from the fully digital banks already in the market.</p>
                
                <p>I was also hands on on the realisation of the concept cards and customer journey map.</p>
                
                <p>With regards to the digital app I was lead of the solution design guaranteeing consistency with the research insights.</p>

                <h3>Validating the viability and affordability of the proposed solutions</h3>
                <p>We did two runs of tests for the services we conceived:</p>
                
                <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <li>first one just testing the scenarios on line with the support of sketched storyboards</li>
                    <li>once we had a clearer idea of potential situations, experience and revised services we proposed an in presence test with a simulation of potential uses of digital services, risks and attacks and evaluated the response of interviewees.</li>

                <div class="placeholder-image">Testing Scenarios</div>
                
                <h3>My role in testing</h3>
                <p>I co-led with a service design colleague the planning and preparation of the tests and I was observer and note taker during the execution. Afterwards I worked with the team for the definition of the recommendations.</p>
